## Introduction

### Background
This project addresses menstrual poverty and stigma in China. Approximately 40 million children in China live in areas of special hardship, with 4 million girls between ages 12 and 16 facing menstrual poverty. A survey by UU Public Welfare shows that about 5% of girls in these areas do not use sanitary napkins, leading to significant health and social issues. According to MeBuEri, 93% of Chinese women suffer from gynecological diseases, 63% due to low-quality sanitary products. Our project seeks to alleviate menstrual poverty in China.

### Preliminary Findings
Our research highlights challenges in providing sanitary napkins in educational institutions, contrasting the availability of personal electronic charging stations and family planning supplies. A survey at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) indicated significant discomfort and stigma around discussing menstruation.

### Purpose and Vision
The project's goal is to normalize the discussion of menstrual health and increase the availability of sanitary napkins in public spaces. We envision a society where providing free period items is recognized as a fundamental human right. The pilot project starts at HKUST Guangzhou, with plans to expand to the Greater Bay Area.

### Scope for This Course
The project encompasses building a vending machine prototype, developing an IoT system, creating a data visualization map, and formulating a rating system for emergency feminine product stations. Efforts also include examining eco-friendly vending machine solutions and educational initiatives to address menstrual stigma.

# Methodology

Our methodology incorporates key techniques from the DSA Lectures of INFH 5000, focusing on data preparation/collection, exploratory data analysis, interactive plot design, and data visualization.

## Data Collection

Data for this study is available [here](https://hkustgz-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/nzhu810_connect_hkust-gz_edu_cn/EefyXBCCXN5Nh31ggxYzMncBJNJ1U4x2EIFxA5FV4S-cVw?e=4%3avTIvdL).

### Field Studies
Field studies were conducted at Taikoo Hui and Landmark shopping malls in Guangzhou, and QingHuiYuan in Foshan, focusing on the availability, number, location, and affordability of emergency feminine product stations.

### Weibo Database Analyses
We analyzed the Weibo database using keywords like "sanitary pad self-service box" to gather data on emergency feminine product stations in Guangdong province for our visualization map.

### Surveys
A survey was developed to understand the community's attitudes towards the availability and affordability of sanitary pads at HKUST(GZ). We used a Stratified Random Sampling approach for a diverse sample.

## Interactive Visualization Map Design

<iframe src="plot.html" width="90%" height="550em"></iframe>

We utilized a dataset detailing locations of Emergency Sanitary Pad Stations, transforming the data into geographical coordinates for analysis. The interactive visualization can be accessed at [https://palaceparis.github.io/INFO5000Coursework/](https://palaceparis.github.io/INFO5000Coursework/).

### Data Transformation
Data preprocessing involved:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Setting unreported station numbers (`NA` values) to zero.
- **Normalization:** Logarithmic normalization was applied to standardize data variance for better interpretation.

### Interactive Map and Scatter Plot Creation
We used ECharts for our visualizations, involving:

1. **Initialization:** Separate containers were set up for the map and scatter plot.
2. **Data Loading and Parsing:** Dataset loaded using jQuery and parsed for structured representation.
3. **Chart Configuration:** ECharts instances were created for the map and scatter plot, using GeoJSON for mapping and log-normalized data for the scatter plot.
4. **Data Grouping:** Data grouped by location type for comparative analysis.
5. **Interactivity:** Interactive features were added for user engagement and data exploration.
6. **Customization:** Styling adjustments for clarity and user interaction.

This methodology enabled us to create an interactive tool for exploring the distribution of Emergency Sanitary Pad Stations.

## Limitations

### Survey Design
Our survey design has limitations that might introduce bias. The framing of questions can lead to skewed results, and the absence of certain options may influence respondents' choices. Additionally, acquiescence bias is a concern, particularly in questions about personal habits and preferences.

### Vending Machine IoT System
We have consulted PhD professionals in IoT and an expert. The interaction flowchart of the vending machine IoT System is as shown below.

[IOT System Demo](https://hkustgz-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mgong081_connect_hkust-gz_edu_cn/EY7chR4BbPhNltFOrgyMpqIBCfkH22MX90KZ3F_L2zHr4g?e=EUZFZ6)

    <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px;">Interaction flowchart between Vending Machine and IoT System.</figcaption>
</figure>

The process can be concluded as follows: After each sale of goods, vending machines report the type, quantity, time, and region of the sold goods to the Internet of Things platform. The Internet of Things platform provides rule engine capabilities, supporting the forwarding of data reported to other cloud services such as Huawei Cloud. It can achieve the forwarding of massive data to MapReduce Service (MRS) through Data Ingestion Service (DIS), After processing the data, it is read and presented as a visual report by the Data Lake Visualization (DLV), achieving one-stop data collection, processing, and analysis.
# Conclusion

Our project combined teamwork, innovative thinking, and effective resource utilization to address the availability of sanitary pads. Key accomplishments include:

- Development of an IoT vending machine prototype for emergency feminine product stations.
- Creation of a data visualization website to analyze sanitary pad stations in Guangdong.
- Establishment of a rating system and execution of a survey to facilitate campus implementation.
- Proposal of policy recommendations aimed at tackling menstrual stigma and poverty.

These initiatives are pivotal in promoting an inclusive and progressive environment in educational institutions, directly benefiting students and staff. Furthermore, they contribute to broader societal advancements in menstrual health and gender equality.

# Future Work

## Sustainable Vending Machine
We are developing a solar-powered off-grid vending machine. The main components include solar panels, charge controllers, batteries, and inverters. For a small 15W vending machine, we need a 300W solar power system and 160 Ah batteries.

## Leveraging Online Suppliers & Lowering Costs
We aim to partner with online platforms for discounts and special offers, and implement programs to provide free or subsidized sanitary products to students in need.

## Sustainable Design & Environmental Awareness
Our focus includes promoting sustainable menstrual products and raising awareness about environmental impacts. We're exploring collaborations to potentially make sanitary napkins recyclable and considering the addition of solar panels to vending machines.

## Health and Hygiene Education
We plan to organize workshops on menstrual health and hygiene, including sustainable practices and proper disposal methods, to raise awareness about women's rights.

## Managing Conflicts of Interest
Future steps include:
1. **Transparent Procurement Processes:** Ensuring transparency in sanitary product procurement.
2. **Diverse Committee Involvement:** Forming a diverse committee to oversee sanitary initiatives and review potential conflicts of interest.
3. **Regular Audits and Reviews:** Conducting audits to ensure the effective and transparent use of funds.

## Upholding University Image
We aim to:
1. **Positive Communication Strategy:** Highlighting the university's commitment to sustainability and gender inclusivity.
2. **Community Engagement:** Involving the university community in decision-making processes.
3. **Collaboration with External Organizations:** Partnering with organizations focused on menstrual health and gender equality.
4. **Regular Updates and Reporting:** Providing updates on initiatives and improvements.

## Legislation Recommendations
We plan to expand our project to schools and promote policies for including sanitary napkins in medical insurance and reducing taxes on feminine hygiene products. We will seek advocacy from members of the National People’s Congress and collaborate with others to mandate the delivery of sanitary napkins in public places.
